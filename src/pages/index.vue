          Introduction
        </template>
        <p>
          I argue for the development of a non-textual general-purpose programming language.
          The idea is not to necessarily create a new "exotic" visual language,
          but rather to mostly stay close to the common structure of established production languages (e.g. C),
          just without source code in textual form.
          While I believe that there is substantial untapped potential that could be exploited by decoupling a language from the typical textual form,
          creating such a new language would naturally be a non-trivial endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page briefly presents a few of the resulting potential advantages and challenges.
          It currently is only intended to vaguely communicate the general idea,
          not a comprehensive discussion.

          1. Decoupled syntax
        </template>
        <p slot="textual">
          Reserved keywords or symbols are a necessity to define a stable text-based syntax.
          Changes and extensions to the language can become difficult without breaking existing code or introducing sub-optimal workarounds.
        </p>
        <p slot="non-textual">
          The internal representation and the displayed code can be fully decoupled,
          eliminating the need for a frozen text-based syntax entirely.

          2. Unrestricted naming
        </template>
        <p slot="textual">
          User-defined names have to be chosen.
          Changing library interface names might break user code.
          Short, undescriptive names might be used to reduce clutter, for quick typing, or for prototyping.
        </p>
        <p slot="non-textual">
          Code parts can be linked via internal IDs.
          Multiple user-defined names can be assigned at arbitrary points in time without breaking any code.
          The display can automatically shorten long names or select short variants if desired by the current developer.
          Automatically created identicons or user-defined icons could be used in addition.

          3. No explicit formatting
        </template>
        <p slot="textual">
          Code style guidelines and specialized tools are created per language to deal with formatting.
          This also includes relatively language-agnostic issues like indentation or naming-schemes (such as camel-case, snake-case, all-caps).
          Version control can't always distinguish pure formatting changes and actual program changes.
        </p>
        <p slot="non-textual">
          There is no need for explicit formatting at all.
          The code display automatically adjusts according to each individual developer's local preferences.
          Names don't need any special scheme.

          4. Direct documentation
        </template>
        <p slot="textual">
          Documentation exists in the form of comments,
          possibly with special syntax to generate dedicated files (e.g. HTML, PDF).
        </p>
        <p slot="non-textual">
          Documentation without formatting restrictions could be attached directly to every part of the code.
          E.g. individual function parameters or specific ranges of code.
          Non-textual information such as images may be inserted and displayed without generating dedicated files.

        Creating a non-textual language also leads to some challenges a new textual language wouldn't have:

            1. Special IDE necessary
          </template>
          Common textual code editors / IDEs obviously can't simply handle a non-textual language
          and trying to build extensions might prove severely inefficient.
          Thus a new specialized IDE would most likely be required to fully realize all potential advantages.

            <img class="section-icon" src="~assets/section/challenge/version-control-tree.svg" /><br>
            2. Textual version control is incompatible
          </template>
            It might be possible to store the internal data using a textual format that sensibly represents changed "lines",
            but the version control usability would surely suffer in contrast to any common explicitly human-readable textual language.

            Instead, a specific version control system could be built into the non-textual language,
            possibly in synergy with the custom IDE to utilize up to perfect editing-step information.

            3. Embedding code snippets outside the IDE
          </template>
          Sharing code snippets without requiring the IDE should be possible without resorting to screenshots.
          This could be done e.g. for web pages via JavaScript libraries analogous to syntax highlighters.
          Or a more general approach might even be to provide exportable textual snippet representations,
          since static snippets shouldn't require the full non-textual language capabilities.

            Prototype
          </template>
          I've started work on a private prototype, beginning with the creation of a custom Ultil IDE.
          This IDE is built in form of a web application.
          The first approach was based on Vue.js (the Quasar Framework to be precise),
          but that was scrapped in favor of a leaner second approach,
          which uses regular JavaScript to control Web APIs directly without any framework.
          This of course allows for more fine-grained control,
          and will also simplify a later rewrite of the Ultil IDE using the Ultil language itself,
          which could be used to represent a JavaScript superset
          (Ultil should be specified in a way that is flexible enough to easily represent any textual programming language,
          although that isn't the primary goal).
          At the currently still early stage of development
          the focus lies on the creation of an effectively usable IDE UI specialized for this non-textual language.
          It is likely that a truly useable Ultil system will take multiple years (starting 2020) to develop,
          assuming the development continues as a solo project in my spare time.
